carbon budget (i.e how much more carbon can be added to teh atmosphere) that would hold the global average temerate at 2 degrees, above pre-industrial levels amounted to approximately 800 billion tonnes of carbon. So far around 570 billion tonnes of extra carbon have been released, with temperatures currently approaching 1.5 celcius above pre-industrial levels
[Radiative forcing: the difference of incoming solar radiation (insolation) absorbed by the Earth and the energy radiated back out into space.]
    ·         Carbon dioxide is the single most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) in the atmosphere, contributing 65% of radiative forcing
    ·         rising levels of carbon dioxide and other GHGs in post-industrial times are fuelling fears of climate change through atmospheric warming
    ·         atmospheric carbon dioxide approached 150% of the pre-industrial level in 2021, mainly due to emissions from fossil-fuel combustion and cement production (caused by the production of clinker, the key constituent of cement)

At current rates of emissions, around 10 billion tonnes of carbon a year, there are about 25 years until what remains of the above carbon budget, about 230 billion tonnes, is released and the global average temperature increases by 2°C. To avoid dangerous climate change, substantial and sustained reductions in carbon dioxide emissions are needed.

One way of doing this is to leave most of the remaining fossil-fuel reserves in the ground and generate our energy in sustainable ways. Another is to remove some of the ‘extra’ carbon from the atmosphere. This could be done by managing forests and other land sinks to increase the amount of carbon they take up. There are also technological solutions known as negative emissions technologies.

One example of this is bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS). If the carbon released by burning fossil fuels is captured before it is released back to the atmosphere, then electricity has been generated without increasing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere or using up any of the carbon budget. However, BECCS is still at an early stage of development. Moreover, the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere cannot be quickly removed, whatever technologies we deploy.

This means a certain amount of global warming is already ‘locked in’: the future will, inevitably, be hotter for the planet.
