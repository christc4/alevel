Conclusions:

Deforestation causes the greatest impact on the Amazon rainforest - in the short term, allowing more rainwater to reach the ground, reducing evaporatranspiration, whereas a long-term look sees climate change likely to have the greatest impact. It is predicted that rainfall amoutns will become less in total and more variable. Climate change could in fact result in the decrease of the forest naturally, through a drier climate, so the two main causes are INTERRELATED.
