When doing base outline, start of with faint colours, build up to more prominent colouring when you feel that your outline has a good semblance to your referance
Dip your brush in clean water, and wipe of any bottom sediment with your fingers, if you've left it exposed to air for a while
A good way to make sure your paint is faint, is by dipping your first paint and applying it to an empty palette space, and dipping your brush again in water, and intyour new pallete spot.
when using the red paper dont move it otherwise you'll smudge it, which isn't a biggie but its best not to have it happen in the first place. also figure out how to open or potnetially recompile ed so it doesnt immediately show ahow many byutes are in a file or find a way to edit the source code so i dont need to suppress the verbose error messages, potentially remove them altogether since id ont use them
